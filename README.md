##The Web is Inefficient, but We can Fix It

If you're a web designer like me, I can tell you that we both have a serious flaw: we're energy inefficient. The overspending of electricity in our designs has far-reaching consequences, has persisted undetected for a long time, and permeates almost every pixel on the Web.

In general, people think about their energy consumption only nine minutes per year, so it's not surprising that you or I have been big energy wasters when it comes to web design. Storing data, sending information, and displaying pixels on screens—all of these things cost a surprising amount of electricity, especially considering the global energy implications of running the Internet. Luckily, this also means that the possibility of energy savings in our industry is significant, and there are some simple things that you and I can do to stop being wasteful. In this talk, I’ll show you just how much energy your sites and apps are using and offer practical, easy tips to help you earn your next rank: efficient web designer!
